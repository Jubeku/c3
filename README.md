# C3 - the CLAIMED Component Compiler

**TL;DR**
- takes arbitrary assets (Jupyter notebooks, python/R/shell/SQL scripts) as input
- automatically creates container images and pushed to container registries
- automatically installes all required dependencies into the container image
- creates KubeFlow Pipeline components (target workflow execution engines are pluggable)
- can be triggered from CICD pipelines
